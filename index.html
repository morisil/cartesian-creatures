      Here is the "genetic" code of a simple cartesian creature:
    </p>
    <pre>
function getColor(x, y, now, context) {
  var red   = x;
  var green = y;
  var blue  = (now / 5) % 256;
  return [red, green, blue];
}</pre>
    <p>
      And such a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype">genotype</a>" translates into
      following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype">phenotype</a>:

      Hint: make the window smaller to improve performance. Or you can go full screen and
      zoom-in (CTRL-+). It will also make animation smoother and sometimes more interesting.

    <h2>Anatomy</h2>
    <!--<img src="media/rembrandt-anatomy-lesson.jpg" class="anatomy-image img-75"/>-->
    <p>
      Let's dissect the original creature:
    </p>
    <pre>
function getColor(x, y, now, context) {
  var red   = x;
  var green = y;
  var blue  = (now / 5) % 256;
  return [red, green, blue];
}</pre>
    <p>
      The <code>getColor</code> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>
      function. On the input it is supplied with coordinates of a pixel on your screen and current
      moment in time expressed as a number. It should return the color.
    </p>
    <p>
      The color is based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model">RGB</a>
      model.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>%</code> stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation">modulo
      operation</a>.
      It represents a reminder after dividing a number by 256. It will guarantee that computed value
      is always within 0-255 range, because 255 is the maximum value we can assign to either red,
      green,
      or blue. The value <code>[0, 0, 0]</code> stands for black while <code>[255, 255, 255]</code>
      stands for white. The value <code>[255, 0, 0]</code> stands for "pure redness".
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>now</code> has to be divided by <code>5</code>, otherwise animation would be too fast.
      You should adjust this factor according to your perceptual needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Achieving more complex visual effects might require additional information over
      <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and <code>now</code>. For example your creatures might feed
      on some values computed before each animation frame. This information can be put in the
      <code>context</code>. All you need is to define <code>setUpContext</code> and
      <code>updateContext</code> functions in your creature's code.
    </p>
    <pre>
// called when animation is loaded
function setUpContext(context) {
  // ... do your things, e.g.:
  context.frameNumber = 0;
  return context;
}</pre>
    <pre>
// called before each animation frame
function updateContext(context) {
  // ... do your things, e.g.:
  context.frameNumber++;
  return context;
}</pre>
    <p>
      The <code>context</code> is just a dictionary you can extend. It comes with some values by default:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>imageData</code> - what's on the screen now</li>
      <li><code>width</code> - canvas width</li>
      <li><code>height</code> - canvas height</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>On Descartes</h2>
    <img src="media/8bit-descartes.png" class="pixel-descartes" />
    <p>
      I remember the joy evoked by lectures of my beloved professor Ewa Kochan. Her dark clothes
      were always covered with
      pieces of cat's fur and she was always wearing interesting brooch, depicting
      different animals and insects. That day she was telling us about
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes">Rene Descartes</a>,
      while walking
      constantly back and forth between the blackboard and the door, reminding us
      about importance of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripatetic_school">peripateic tradition</a> in our
      own kind. In this symbiosis of movement and
      speech she was slowly getting more articulated and somehow excited. She was submerged
      in contemplation of memes which came out of another mind from the past. But it suddenly
      stopped. She stopped, both speaking and moving. After a moment she said: "I just became
      so cartesian, do I even like Descartes? Let me think". The professor resumed her trajectory,
      but she was silent, for several seconds. And
      we all froze while starring at her in this unbelievably dramatic suspense. Eventually she
      spoke: "My dear, moderately, moderately indeed!", The digression was over, the dramatic
      tension was released. Like if the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_return">eternal recurrence</a> was resumed in
      this power of movement involving body and mind. The movement producing divinity. The only
      believable one because these gods can dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Descartes was born to early to know the theory of evolution. He might have suspect something
      after dissecting so many specimens. He new math though, quite well.
      Till today our notebooks and computer screens are infected by his memes of the coordinate
      system. He also threw us into the abyss of narcissistic interest in own consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He denied consciousness of other animals though. His studies in anatomy and behaviour led him
      to the conclusion that other creatures are just mere machines - examples of a very complex
      God's clockwork.
      And our cartesian
      creatures are not much different. Not conscious, simple, living in a very limited environment.
      But still I develop some kind of personal relation with each them. On the spectrum between
      chaotic randomness, and complex simulations of artificial life, there is always this
      homeostasis emerging out of math functions stabilizing visuals over entropy. And the tension
      between these two primordial forces - static and dynamic, to stabilize and to mutate,
      to preserve and to revolutionize. It seems to be immanent to any system emerging over
      replicators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Descartes made us believe that retrospective is enough to know anything, as the only
      way the world is represented is in our minds. And if the nature of this experience is
      subjective, then leading to extreme forms of solipsyzm.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if there is anything we would call objective, or rather intersubjective, it's what's
      communicable. The language. We had to wait till the beginning of the 20th century, for so
      called new linguistic paradigm. When the idea was born, that if language, the code, represents
      reality in any sense, than studying the language is enough to know what can be known.
      In Wittgenstein words:
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the beginning of the code. But it was also the end of our specie. The 3rd replicator
      was born.
    </p>

  <section id="why">
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>
      Initially I just wanted to make coding such visuals as easy as possible, without any
      programming environment, directly in your browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      While writing this documentation I also realized that I want to pay a tribute to the pixel
      graphics on 8-bit computers,
      especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">Commodore 64</a>, which was
      my first machine. Not only mine, for the whole generation it was like an entry into another
      dimension, letting us start programming straight away from this friendly blue screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe that the ability to code should be accessible for everyone. And it should be fun
      as well. It helps
      when we are making the connection between what we type as a code and what we see on
      the screen as an effect. I hope this project will help.
